<h2>This is my portfolio documentation page.It was built using HTML5 & CSS</h2>
<p>
  Project built as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack-Web-Development-Course to demonstrate the mastery of full-stack JavaScript develpoment with MERN stack.

This README contains technical and content-related details about the server-side and client-side component of a React application called "myFlix". The REST API for "myFlix" is hosted online on Heroku and provides logged in users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. For detailed information about all the provided features, see Features sector. The server-side of the application (server, business logic, business layers) consists of a REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

The REST API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). CRUD is used to retrieve data from the database and store that data in a non-relational way.
